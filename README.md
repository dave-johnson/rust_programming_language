## Learning Rust
This repo contains the sample code created while going through the [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book)

There is also a YouTube channel from [Let's get Rusty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX9HJsJUDxA&list=PLai5B987bZ9CoVR-QEIN9foz4QCJ0H2Y8&index=1) if you want to see someone do the samples.
